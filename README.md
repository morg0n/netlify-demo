# netlify-demo


Originally a website purposed for a friend that I am going to break a bit to teach someone new to programming how to get involved and understand some basics!

Going to tagteam this with them and perform as a contributer alongside to teach more efficiently (retrospective decision based on my own self-learning)

Goal is to fix this, build on it, surprise original client with completed project and then team up to move onto another standalone.

Please request to contribute rather than just slapping stuff around, as this project does have a goal in mind.
